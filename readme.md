We ask you to get involved in the project to create a safe and free webspace. The universe shall become an uncomplicated and user friendly Web-Desktop for users who don´t want to get tracked by providers and companies during their online activities.
It is an space where the own datas and documents can be safed, managed and shared. It is possible to use the chat with buddies and colleagues also within the connected Instant Messenger for all portable devices. The universe connects the functions of a web-desktop and a social network.



Installation
--------------
Do not install the universe, if you don't know what you are doing.
Right now, we do not recommend to handle sensitive data. Because everyone can read the source code which has just recently been published we think that it´s just a matter of time until mistakes will be found. But every reported mistake is a mistake we learn from and if you help us to find them we can avoid bad people of abusing them.

Run the Installer
1. Download and extract the file on the Webspace of your choice.
2. Open /install/
3. Run the installer



Security
----------
We try to get the script as secure as possible. It is important to point out the most important things we need to take care of:
    1. Javascript Cryptography
    2. A good Cryptoprotocoll which allows
        A Public Key Infrastructure
        Instant Messaging (with Groups)
        An easy exchange of algorithms
    3. Well written and well documented code

----------
Update between the Beta version and now:
We improved the usability and design and added more functionality: Adding services like the Wikipedia and video services like Youtube is much easier now.
Also, the source code has been tidied out and documented and is ready for public release.

=Close Future=
---------------
-Decentralize the whole architecture

-Find ways to give the single user more ways of democratic participation

-Enable different ways of crypto

-We haven't changed the crypto since the release of the Beta. We plan to overhaul the entire crypto protocol. We're looking for help here! So if you're interested in participating, give us a shout.

-Add an easy way to let everyone develope apps
